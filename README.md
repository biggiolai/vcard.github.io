Our company will no longer provide traditional paper business cards but will instead switch to using modern digital business cards to better adapt to the current business environment and sustainable development principles.

As technology continues to advance, traditional paper business cards have become outdated and environmentally unfriendly. Digital business cards are a modern, convenient, and eco-friendly solution that can be easily stored on your mobile device and shared with others anytime, anywhere. This transition will not only simplify the management and exchange of business cards but also contribute to reducing paper waste and promoting environmental awareness.

Our digital business cards will include your personal contact information, company details, social media links, and other relevant information to ensure you can effectively connect with partners and clients. These digital cards can be easily shared through email, text messages, social media, and various communication platforms, thereby increasing your business contact efficiency.

Tips:
### You can always access the personal page either with QRCode or the url formatted with https://vcard.ethirteen.com/name , ex: Yumi Lin => https://vcard.ethirteen.com/yumil

### You can print the QRcode somewhere so users could access those cards without your phone. That could be used in the booth, event or office location.

### "Save Contact" in the personal page don't mean it will save contact directly into your phone. Further steps might be needed depending on phone brand or system using. 
For iphone, you need to scroll down to the bottom and choose "Create New Contact" or merge with existing contact.
